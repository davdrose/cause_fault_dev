                "text": "\n This study is a follow-up study for a series of our previous studies.\n In our previous studies, we wanted to know if “causes to break” and “break” mean the same thing. Though many researchers think they do, children may think they don’t. We found that when hearing a story where Suzy was riding her bike, hit Andy and he fell into the fence and it broke, young children, e.g. 4 and 5 year olds, say that Suzy caused the fence to break and Andy broke it. Similarly, when told that Sophia scared Bobby and he fell into a mirror and the mirror cracked, children said that Sophia caused the mirror to crack and that Bobby cracked it. These findings suggest that young children don’t think that “causes to break” and “break” mean the same thing. Note that “causing to break” and “break” are both statements about causation. So in saying that, for instance, Suzy caused the fence to break and that Andy broke it, we are making two different causal judgments. And if we are making two different causal judgments this raises questions about how we resolve responsibility. Most researchers think that being responsible for an outcome requires that you caused the outcome to occur. But how do we decide responsibility when making two different causal judgments? Though nobody has examined this question, we think our findings will make a contribution to understanding how, over development, we resolve issues of responsibility when making different causal judgments. \n Although children’s answers can vary, there aren’t any “right” or “wrong” answers to the questions. We are just interested in looking at the average responses from children and we won’t take any specific answers as “good” or “bad”.\n If you are interested in learning more about this, please see the following experimental paper with adults <a href='https://philpapers.org/rec/ROSCAB-3' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>here</a>.

In the other story, Sophia and Bobby are in a room. One of them decides to play a trick on the other one. At the end, someone falls into a mirror. After seeing this, your child will be asked a couple of questions.  We are interested in how children use different causal verbs to describe the two incidents, and how they decide who is responsible for the outcome.
