# Experiments Overview

This project investigates children's understanding of causation and fault across different scenarios. The experiments were designed for children aged 3-9 and conducted using the [Lookit](https://childrenhelpingscience.com/) platform.

## Experiment 1: Fault Question First vs. Last Ordering

### Pre-Registrations
- Fault question first ordering: [Link](https://osf.io/2u4fp)
- Fault question last ordering: [Link](https://osf.io/f4n6w)

### Description
Children were presented with two chain scenarios:  
1. **Scenario 1**: Suzy and Andy are in the park. One of them is riding a bike very fast and crashes into the other. Eventually, someone falls into a fence, causing it to break.  
2. **Scenario 2**: Sophia and Bobby are in a room. One of them plays a trick on the other, resulting in someone falling into a mirror and cracking it.  

For each scenario, participants were asked three types of questions:  
- **Lexical Questions**: "Who broke the fence?"  
- **Causal Questions**: "Who caused the fence to break?"  
- **Fault Questions**: "Whose fault is it that the fence broke?"  

### Implementation on Lookit
The child-friendly version was implemented on [Lookit](https://childrenhelpingscience.com/). To preview the experiment:  
1. Create a dummy experiment on Lookit.  
2. Navigate to **"Edit Study Design"** in the right-hand column.  
3. Go to **"Protocol Configuration"** and paste the experiment's JSON file.  
4. Click **"Save Changes"** and then **"Preview Study"** from the study's main page.

## Experiment 2: Absence Situations

### Pre-Registration
- [Link](https://osf.io/sjakw)

### Description
Children were presented with two absence scenarios:  
1. **Scenario 1**: Suzy and Andy go wall climbing. One of them is holding the rope for the other but lets go, causing the other to fall onto a fan and break it.  
2. **Scenario 2**: Sophia and Bobby are playing tug-of-war in the yard. One of them lets go of the rope, and the other falls into a window, cracking it.  

For each scenario, participants were asked the same three types of questions:  
- **Lexical Questions**: "Who broke the fan?"  
- **Causal Questions**: "Who caused the fan to break?"  
- **Fault Questions**: "Whose fault is it that the fan broke?"  

### Implementation on Lookit
The implementation process is identical to Experiment 1:  
1. Create a dummy experiment on Lookit.  
2. Navigate to **"Edit Study Design"** in the right-hand column.  
3. Paste the experiment's JSON file in **"Protocol Configuration"**.  
4. Save changes and preview the study.
